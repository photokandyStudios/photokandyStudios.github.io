While the Greek Interlinear Bible app isn't technically *open source*, the source *is* made available under a
Creative Commons Non-commercial Share-Alike Attribution license. There is a non-compete clause as well that
means you can't use this code to create another interlinear app without getting permission from us first. Beyond that,
you can build the code yourself and hack on it to create interesting features.

There are two repositories -- the first contains the source code, and the second contains the Bible sources and other
shareable assets. We can't, for various reasons, distribute the Bible database itself on the repository, but you can
recreate a similar verson using the scripts and data provided in the second repository.

* [Primary Repository](https://github.com/photokandyStudios/gbible){: target="_blank"}: Source Code
* [Secondary Repository](https://github.com/photokandyStudios/gbible-scripts-assets){: target="_blank"}: Bible sources, shareable assets, and scripts
