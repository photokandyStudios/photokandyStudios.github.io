So, it's 2014, and this site has been due for a redesign. As such, we've completely redone the look and feel of the site
and made it even more responsive. We also started using Jekyll to generate the site rather than use a single page
design as the prior design used.

While we've tested in several browsers and on many different devices, if you *do* find something that is broken,
[let us know]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/).
