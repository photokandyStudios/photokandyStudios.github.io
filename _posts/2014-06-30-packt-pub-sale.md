So Packt Publishing is celebrating its 10th birthday, and in honor of the event, they are making every one of their e-books and videos available for $10. In 10 years, they've published 2,000 books -- which is absolutely amazing, and you can get as many e-books as you want for $10 until July 5th, 2014.

So if you need to stock up on some good technical reading, now's the time!
