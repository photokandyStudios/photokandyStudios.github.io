I've been working with technology for most of my life, starting at an early age on a Commodore 64. I still fondly remember the beige computer with slow floppy disk drive and learning BASIC from the manual. I love to develop [apps (mobile and desktop)]({{ site.baseurl }}/apps/), and to help others do the same. I am an avid photographer, and can be found out and about making pictures of just about anything. I'm also an [IT Consultant]({{ site.baseurl }}/services/consulting/), working with websites and databases. I've [written three books]({{ site.baseurl }}/books/) about mobile app development, and I'm active on various social networks &mdash; some more than others.

Personally, I love to work with my fresh-water aquariums. I have two: a 37 gallon aquarium and a 20
gallon aquarium. Favorite fish include Bettas, Platys, Pictus, Plecos, and Catfish. I also enjoy
performing and composing music. My favorite instrument is the piano.

I like to write about various subjects, so be sure to [check out the blogs]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/).
