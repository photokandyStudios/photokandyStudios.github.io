This book is a the first edition of my current book,
[PhoneGap 3.x Mobile Application Development Hotshot](../phonegap-3-x-hotshot). This book, on the other hand, is written
for PhoneGap 2.x, and as such, it is out-of-date.

The book explores several important topics, including localization and globalization, persistent storage, audio recording and
playback, video recording and playback, image capture, GPS, the accelerometer, and much, much more. To explore these topics,
the book guides you through the development of several apps, including productivity apps, a social networking app, and a couple games.

## Build Fully Functional Apps

Build ten fully functional applications that demonstrate the various features discussed in the book. Each app is cross
platform, supporting iOS and Android.
