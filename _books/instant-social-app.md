This book takes you through the creation of a simple social networking application using Phonegap and Twitter.

"Instant PhoneGap Social App Development" shows you how to create compelling mobile apps that integrate with social media based on Phonegap. The book will show you how to consume Twitter feeds and also share content to Twitter using Twitter Web Intents.

Using code listings and easy steps, this book will guide you through the process of creating a Phonegap app, adding plugins, and using the Twitter API and Twitter’s web intents.

You’ll learn how to install PhoneGap plugins so that you can extend the capabilities of your application. You’ll also be introduced to Twitter’s JSON API and Twitter’s Web Intents which allow the consuming of feed content and the posting of content to Twitter respectively. Along the way, you’ll also learn how to create a cross-platform mobile app that works on iOS and Android.
