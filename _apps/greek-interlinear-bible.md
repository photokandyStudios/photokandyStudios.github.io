# Study the Original

Read the Bible in several different Greek Versions: The Byzantine/Majority Text (2000), Tischendorf 8th Ed. (1869), Textus Receptus (1550) with variants of Scrivener 1894, and the Westcott/Hort/USB4 Variants (1881). Parallel Versions are the World English Bible and Young's Literal Translation. (King James / Authorized Version is available for download where permitted.)

# Downloadable Content

You can now download various translations of the Bible, including for different languages. More are being added all the time, so check "Manage Bibles" in "Settings" often!

# Parsed with Strong's Lookups

All except Tischendorf 8th Ed. have parsed editions indexed with Strong's Lookups. Just press-and-hold on a Strong's number to search the dictionary. The dictionary is from Strong's Exhaustive Concordance (1890), prepared in 2006 by Ulrik Petersen.

# Mark It Up

With several different highlighter colors to choose from, you can make your text reflect your study. And with lots of layout settings, you can make the Bible look just how you like -- whether it be larger text, different column sizes, different typefaces -- the possibilities are myriad. There are also themes that help when reading at night.

# Write in the Margins

Okay, not quite literally. But you can attach notes of just about any length to any verse and review them later. Or, if you want to read your notes along with the text, you can display them inline. When writing notes, the editor has been enhanced to permit easy verse lookup and Strong's lookup, and on the iPad, there's a fifth row on the keyboard permitting quick access to commonly used symbols.

# Search the Word

Advanced full-text search of the entire Bible for both the Greek and English translations. Want to know every verse that contains the word "prophet"? Now you can. Note: To search for Greek words, it is suggested that you add the Greek keyboard to your device in the Settings app.

# Copy the Text

If you want to copy the content and paste it somewhere else, like in an email or presentation, you can copy one verse, or multiple at once. The text includes both the Greek and English versions, and any notes that might be attached in the selection.

# Online or Offline

The full version of each text is included within the application itself, so you don't need an active connection to the Internet to do your studies. If you are online, you can look up verses and content on various websites.
